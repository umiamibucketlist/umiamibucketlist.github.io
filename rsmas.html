                <p>I caught the shuttle to the campus on Virginia Key, so that I could see UM's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science for the first time. This is what I saw...</p>

                <p>I walked to the pier and looked out at Biscayne Bay. The university's research vessel (i.e. a boat with the 'U' logo on it) is right there on the water, and there's a shoreline that students can use as a beach. (I saw two marine science freshmen spending their Friday afternoon in swimsuits.)</p>

                <p>I also checked out WetLab, the campus's waterfront bar, when it opened up shop at 4:30 p.m. WetLab has craft beers on draft and even a few wine varieties. It also seemed cheaper than the Rathskeller. And it had some incredible sounding bar food options, like a grilled cheese with multiple types of cheese plus bacon. I was surprised to learn that, during the day, WetLab is actually a restaurant called Salt. Can you believe the view?</p>
