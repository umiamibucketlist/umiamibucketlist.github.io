            <h4>Viernes Culturales</h4>

            <img src="img/cubaocho.jpg" alt="Cuba Ocho" width="520 px" />

            <p>Viernes Culturales in Little Havana happens on the fourth Friday of every month. Despite my Cuban heritage, I can't say I frequent Calle Ocho, so I've been wanting to experience this event for a while now. Art vendors were stationed next to Domino Park (I met an artist who lives in Cuba), and street performers were blasting music, with impromptu dancers joining in. The local bars, like <a href="www.cubaocho.com">Cuba Ocho</a> and <a href="www.ballandchainmiami.com/">Ball and Chain</a>, were full of life.</p>

            <p>My favorite part of the experience, however, was finally getting to try <a href="www.azucaricecream.com/">Azucar Ice Cream</a>. (For anyone who knows me, this should come as no surprise.)</p>

            <img src="img/icecream.jpg" alt="Abuela Maria ice cream" width="520 px" />

            <p>I ordered a scoop of Abuela Maria, which has guava mixed with Maria cookies, and it put me in the right mood. I also tried a sample of the Cafe con Leche ice cream, which is probably what I'll order whenever I'm back there.</p>
