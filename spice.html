             <h4>Miami Spice</h4>

             <p>So far, I've dined at <a href="www.essensiarestaurant.com/">Essensia</a> for dinner, <a href="www.pubbellyboys.com/lechon/">L'echon Brasserie</a> for lunch, <a href="www.mortons.com/">Morton's The Steakhouse</a> for dinner (by accident), and I plan to go to <a href="hakkasan.com/">Hakkasan</a> for dim sum lunch as soon as I can actually get a reservation.</p>

             <ol>
                <li><strong>Essensia</strong></li>
                <p>Dinner was good, but it didn't blow my mind. The steak melted in my mouth, and I liked the mango chutney that accompanied the Indian-inspired chicken dish. However, dessert tasted like a condensed frozen Thai coconut lemongrass soup, which is confusing to say the least.</p>
                <li><strong>L'echon Brasserie</strong></li>
                <p>The Pubbelly Group never disappoints. In each of the dishes, the flavor of each ingredient stood out just as it should: the leeks in the Scottish salmon dish, the cinnamon-y flavor of the pizza-like ham tart. </p>
                <li><strong>Morton's The Steakhouse</strong></li>
                <p>First things first, under ordinary circumstances, I would never eat at a chain restaurant for Miami Spice. But I went to Morton's for dinner with my family because my dad had gift cards; we didn't even realize there was a Miami Spice menu until the server brought it to our table. I ordered the filet mignon -- because who's going to go to a steakhouse and not eat steak? -- and actually thought it was worth it.</p>
