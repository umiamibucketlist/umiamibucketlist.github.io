             <h4>Story and Set</h4>

             <p>So I decided to check out a bit of South Beach nightlife (not my usual scene) and go club hopping. If anyone is curious, apparently this is what clubbing looks like:</p>

             <ol>
                <li><strong>Story</strong></li>
                <p>Story is supposed to be one of the best clubs in South Beach -- the Miami Heat partied there for its last championship victory, so it's popularity is quickly surpassing LIV -- but I was unimpressed. It's huge. Too huge. All they played was house music with no words (the type you can barely dance to). Drink prices are through the roof. It's full of foreign tourists. I don't think I'll be back there again, unless a DJ I really want to see is performing.</p>
                <li><strong>Set</strong></li>
                <p>SO MUCH MORE FUN. It's a smaller venue, but the entire place has a VIP-feel. It's owned by the same group that runs Mansion. The music was great, and we danced on furniture. The hyped ambiance was much closer to what I was looking for, and I'm glad I found it.</p>
